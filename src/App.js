              "EPA has updated List N to include the types of surfaces products
              can be used on (e.g., hard or soft) and use sites (e.g., hospital,
              institutional or residential). Products that can be applied via
              fogging are now noted in the formulation column. This additional
              information will empower the public to choose products that are
              appropriate for their specific circumstances." <br />
